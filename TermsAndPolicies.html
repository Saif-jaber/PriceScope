            <h1 id="privacy-policy" style="font-size: 40px; margin-top: 0px;">Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>At PriceScope, we are committed to safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of information we do (and do not) collect, how it is used, and the principles we follow to protect user data.</p>
            
            <h1 id="Data collection">1. Data Collection</h1>
            <p>PriceScope does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII). Users may freely search for products without registration, login, or tracking. No cookies, session identifiers, or third-party analytics tools are used.</p>

            <h1 id="search activity">2. Search Activity</h1>
            <p>All product searches are performed anonymously and are not recorded or logged. Any data retrieved from external sources (e.g., product listings or prices) is used strictly for real-time display and is not stored.</p>

            <h1 id="third-party-services">3. Third-Party Services</h1>
            <p>PriceScope interfaces with external e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon, Noon, AliExpress, Shein) to retrieve publicly available product data. These platforms have their own privacy policies, and PriceScope assumes no responsibility for their data handling practices once users are redirected.</p>

            <h1 id="security">4. Security</h1>
            <p>Although PriceScope does not store user data, we maintain a high standard of security in our codebase and network architecture to ensure platform integrity.</p>
